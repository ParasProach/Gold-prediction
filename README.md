# Gold Mineralization Prediction

A machine learning–based project for predicting gold mineralization using geological and spatial features.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project applies supervised machine learning techniques to predict the presence of gold mineralization using global mineral occurrence data. Geological attributes, spatial coordinates, and associated commodity information are used to build predictive models.

An interactive dashboard and web interface are also developed to visualize and explore gold occurrence patterns.

## 🧠 Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- XGBoost Classifier

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- ROC–AUC

Ensemble models (Random Forest and XGBoost) achieved the best performance.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure
- `predictive Project.py` → Data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training & evaluation
- `app.py` → Streamlit-based web interface for prediction
- `README.md` → Project documentation

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Matplotlib
- Streamlit
- Power BI (for dashboard visualization)

## 📌 Note on Dataset
The dataset used is a global mineral occurrence dataset.
Due to size and licensing constraints, the dataset is not included in this repository.
